# Gyte

This is a simple bash script to stage specified files, prompt for a commit message, and push changes to Github.
The idea stemmed from one of my mentors called Brian, whom for some reason, doesn't want to be exposed on any public forum.
Anyone from ALX program reading this (Nessy!), isn't it exhausting to 

```
git add <file>
git commit <message>
git push

```
Lol!
Now, gyte is a name that came on the fly. Must be the heavy python coding I did in the preceding years.
