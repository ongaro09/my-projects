# About

- A whatsapp chat bot that sends me reminders of my tasks via whatsapp. One might ask, why not set reminders in Google calendar?
- Well, doesn't work for me. Smartphones are too distruptive during deep learning/work. I prefer not to check my emails when hooked. 
- Very few people have access to my work number, the same number that happens to be linked to Whatsapp web. I prefer to filter
  only important reminders that time my smartphone is off.
