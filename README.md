# My Projects

A collection of my personal projects, including scripts and tools I use offline to speed up my workflow. Each
directory contains a self-contained project or script.

## Contents

1. [ocr-script](./ocr-script) - A Node.js script that performs OCR on an image using Tesseract.js.
2. [gyte](./gyte) - A Bash script to stage specific files, prompt for a commit message, and push to GitHubâ€”all in one command.
3. [password-generator](./password-generator) - A password generator written in C. Perfect for anyone wanting to avoid reusing passwords and store them in a database under full control.

## Motivation 

I'm foreign to web dev, but as a consumer, I find web-based apps as often slow and sometimes I get frustrated when
I want to get my work done within a set time-frame. Average consumers in Kenya like myself don't own 'super-fast' 
computers. I wonder why web developers don't target this critical mass. 

Other scripts like gyte are meant to keep things simple, but overall the goal is to enhance productivity.
