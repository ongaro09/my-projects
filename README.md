## Motivation 

I'm foreign to web dev, but as a consumer, I find web-based apps as often flow and sometimes I get frustrated when
I want to get my work done within a set time-frame. Average consumers in Kenya like myself don't own 'super-fast' 
computers. I wonder why web developers don't target this critical mass. 

## How to Use
